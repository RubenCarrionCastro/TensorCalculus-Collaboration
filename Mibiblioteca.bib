	abstract = {The topology of the causal boundary for standard static spacetimes—spacetimes time-invariantly conformal to a metric product of the Lorentz line and a Riemannian manifold—is studied in depth. As this is given in terms of a set of real-valued functions on the Riemannian factor, one could use a function-space topology, but physical reasons recommend a chronological topology instead. The function-space topology has a simple product structure, while the chronological topology might not. This paper examines when the chronological topology coincides with the function-space topology and when it has a simple product structure. A class of standard static spacetimes is examined, all of which yield a simple product structure for the causal boundary; the conformal class of these spacetimes includes classical spacetimes such as external Schwarzschild or Reissner–Nordström.}

We prove that ( M , g ) splits globally as a standard conformastationary spacetime with respect to K if and only if ( M , g ) is distinguishing (and, thus causally continuous). Causal but non-distinguishing spacetimes with complete stationary vector fields are also exhibited. For the proof, the recently solved 'folk problems' on smoothability of time functions (moreover, the existence of a temporal function) are used.}

	abstract = {This is intended as an analysis of the global properties of static and stationary spacetimes with complete (timelike) Killing field, with particular attention to quotients by group actions. This is presented in terms of algebraic structures which are fairly simple for the static case and more involved for the stationary case; the most important tool, the fundamental cocycle, is a cohomological class for static spacetimes but of somewhat looser structure in the stationary case. In particular: (1) A new measurement, similar to the spacetime interval in Minkowski space, is devised for detecting whether two points are causally related in a stationary spacetime; this proves very useful for analysis. (2) All stationary spacetimes are categorized by how they behave with respect to the fundamental cocycle; this enables a complete characterization of global causality properties. (3) It is shown how these tools determine whether global hyperbolicity of a stationary spacetime is inherited by its quotients. (4) Examples are examined in detail, a large range including both ones of mathematical curiosity and ones of physical interest, such as cosmic strings in flat, accelerated, Schwarzschild, Kerr, and other backgrounds.}

The CFT 3 is the Euclidean Sp ( N ) vector model with anticommuting scalars. The free CFT 3 flows under a double-trace deformation to an interacting CFT 3 in the IR. We argue that both CFTs are dual to Vasiliev dS 4 gravity but with different future boundary conditions on the bulk scalar field. Our analysis rests heavily on analytic continuations of bulk and boundary correlators in the proposed duality relating the O ( N ) model with Vasiliev gravity in AdS 4 .}

	abstract = {It is argued that the general four-dimensional extremal Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS black hole is holographically dual to a (chiral half of a) two-dimensional CFT, generalizing an argument given recently for the special case of extremal Kerr. Specifically, the asymptotic symmetries of the near-horizon region of the general extremal black hole are shown to be generated by a Virasoro algebra. Semiclassical formulae are derived for the central charge and temperature of the dual CFT as functions of the cosmological constant, Newton's constant and the black hole charges and spin. We then show, assuming the Cardy formula, that the microscopic entropy of the dual CFT precisely reproduces the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking area law. This CFT description becomes singular in the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom limit where the black hole has no spin. At this point a second dual CFT description is proposed in which the global part of the U(1) gauge symmetry is promoted to a Virasoro algebra. This second description is also found to reproduce the area law. Various further generalizations including higher dimensions are discussed.}

The CFT 3 is the Euclidean Sp ( N ) vector model with anticommuting scalars. The free CFT 3 flows under a double-trace deformation to an interacting CFT 3 in the IR. We argue that both CFTs are dual to Vasiliev dS 4 gravity but with different future boundary conditions on the bulk scalar field. Our analysis rests heavily on analytic continuations of bulk and boundary correlators in the proposed duality relating the O ( N ) model with Vasiliev gravity in AdS 4 .},

	abstract = {Intuitively, a foliation corresponds to a decomposition of a manifold into a union of connected, disjoint submanifolds of the same dimension, called leaves, which pile up locally like pages of a book. The theory of foliations, as it is known, began with the work of C. Ehresmann and G. Reeb, in the 1940's; however, as Reeb has himself observed, already in the last century P. Painleve saw the necessity of creating a geometric theory (of foliations) in order to better understand the problems in the study of solutions of holomorphic differential equations in the complex field. The development of the theory of foliations was however provoked by the following question about the topology of manifolds proposed by H. Hopf in the 3 1930's: "Does there exist on the Euclidean sphere S a completely integrable vector field, that is, a field X such that X$\cdot$ curl X \textbullet{} 0?" By Frobenius' theorem, this question is equivalent to the following: "Does there exist on the 3 sphere S a two-dimensional foliation?" This question was answered affirmatively by Reeb in his thesis, where he 3 presents an example of a foliation of S with the following characteristics: There exists one compact leaf homeomorphic to the two-dimensional torus, while the other leaves are homeomorphic to two-dimensional planes which accu$\-$ mulate asymptotically on the compact leaf. Further, the foliation is C"".},

Here, we start a systematic study of their main geodesic properties: geodesic completeness, geodesic connectedness and multiplicity causal character of connecting geodesics. These results are independent of the possibility of a full integration of geodesic equations. Variational and geometrical techniques are applied systematically. In particular, we prove that the asymptotic behavior of H(x,u) with x at infinity determines many properties of geodesics. Essentially, a subquadratic growth of H ensures geodesic completeness and connectedness, while the critical situation appears when H(x,u) behaves in some direction as |x|2|x|2|\{$\backslash$kern 1pt\} x\{$\backslash$kern 1pt\} |\^2 , as in the classical model of exact gravitational waves.},

This work contains the results of a study performed with these three compounds, in order to demonstrate their neuropsycholeptic activity in comparison with chloropromazine (CPZ) and chlordiazepoxide (CPD). The inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that the compounds reduce the normal spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone. The central-depressant activity is evidenced by increased barbiturate-induced sleep and a remarkable eyelid ptosis can also be observed. Our compounds do not show any activity on electroshock just as do CPZ and CPD. As to the antipsychotic outline, our compounds show strong reduction of lethality due to amphetamine in grouped mice and a strong antiapomorphine activity. They show also an antiaggressive effect and an inhibitory activity on avoidance behaviour much stronger than CPZ. We have also found extrapyramidal effects, as catalepsy, common to many tranquillizers of the kind of the standards used by us. As for vegetative phenomena, the compounds show hypotensive dose related action ranging from moderate to strong, probably due to an a-receptor inhibition. Adrenolytic activity against lethal doses of adrenaline, antiserotonin and antihistaminic effects, as well as other actions (hypothermia, analgesia, etc.) confirm that RMI 61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are endowed with pharmacologic properties similar and more potent than those of CPZ. Studies on the metabolism of brain catecholamines show that they are similar to CPZ, although with less effect on dopamine level.},

We find that the only vacuum solutions admitting an infinitesimal proper conformal symmetry are everywhere locally flat spacetimes and certain plane wave solutions. We show that if the dominant energy condition is assumed, then Minkowski spacetime is the only asymptotically flat solution which has an infinitesimal conformal symmetry that is asymptotic to a dilation. In other words, with the exceptions cited, homothetic or conformal Killing fields are in fact Killing in spatially compact or asymptotically flat spactimes. In the conformal procedure for solving the initial value problem, we show that data with infinitesimal conformal symmetry evolves to a spacetime with full isometry.",

As a consequence, the qualitative behavior of the c-boundary (at the three levels: point-set, chronology and topology) of a wide class of spacetimes is obtained.}

	abstract = {It is gratifying to learn that there is new life in an old field that has been at the center of one's existence for over a quarter of a century. It is particularly pleasing that the subject of Riemann surfaces has attracted the attention of a new generation of mathematicians from (newly) adjacent fields (for example, those interested in hyperbolic manifolds and iterations of rational maps) and young physicists who have been convinced (certainly not by mathematicians) that compact Riemann surfaces may play an important role in their (string) universe. We hope that non-mathematicians as well as mathematicians (working in nearby areas to the central topic of this book) will also learn part of this subject for the sheer beauty and elegance of the material (work of Weierstrass, Jacobi, Riemann, Hilbert, Weyl) and as healthy exposure to the way (some) mathematicians write about mathematics. We had intended a more comprehensive revision, including a fuller treatment of moduli problems and theta functions. Pressure of other commitments would have substantially delayed (by years) the appearance of the book we wanted to produce. We have chosen instead to make a few modest additions and to correct a number of errors. We are grateful to the readers who pointed out some of our mistakes in the first edition; the responsibility for the remaining mistakes carried over from the first edition and for any new ones introduced into the second edition remains with the authors.

In this paper, we consider the notion of isocausality given by Garc{\'\i}a-Parrado and Senovilla, and introduce a framework to carry out isocausal comparisons with standard stationary spacetimes. As a consequence, the qualitative behavior of the c-boundary (at the three levels: point-set, chronology and topology) of a wide class of spacetimes is obtained.},

As this is given in terms of a set of real-valued functions on the Riemannian factor, one could use a function-space topology, but physical reasons recommend a chronological topology instead. The function-space topology has a simple product structure, while the chronological topology might not. This paper examines when the chronological topology coincides with the function-space topology and when it has a simple product structure. A class of standard static spacetimes is examined, all of which yield a simple product structure for the causal boundary; the conformal class of these spacetimes includes classical spacetimes such as external Schwarzschild or Reissner\textendash{}Nordstr{\"o}m.},

Approaches to this problem have involved the introduction of Lorentzian Busemann functions and the study of the geometry of their level sets---the horospheres. The regularity theory in the Lorentzian case is considerably more complicated and less complete than in the Riemannian case. In this paper, we introduce a broad generalization of the notion of horosphere in Lorentzian geometry and take a completely different (and highly geometric) approach to regularity. These generalized horospheres are defined in terms of achronal limits, and the improved regularity we obtain is based on regularity properties of achronal boundaries. We establish a splitting result for generalized horospheres, which when specialized to Cauchy horospheres yields new results on the Bartnik splitting conjecture, a concrete realization of the problem posed by Yau. Our methods are also applied to spacetimes with positive cosmological constant. We obtain a rigid singularity result for future asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes related to results in Andersson and Galloway (Adv Theor Math Phys 6:307--327, 2002), and Cai and Galloway (Adv Theor Math Phys 3:1769--1783, 2000).",

	abstract = {This is intended as an analysis of the global properties of static and stationary spacetimes with complete (timelike) Killing field, with particular attention to quotients by group actions. This is presented in terms of algebraic structures which are fairly simple for the static case and more involved for the stationary case; the most important tool, the fundamental cocycle, is a cohomological class for static spacetimes but of somewhat looser structure in the stationary case. In particular: (1) A new measurement, similar to the spacetime interval in Minkowski space, is devised for detecting whether two points are causally related in a stationary spacetime; this proves very useful for analysis. (2) All stationary spacetimes are categorized by how they behave with respect to the fundamental cocycle; this enables a complete characterization of global causality properties. (3) It is shown how these tools determine whether global hyperbolicity of a stationary spacetime is inherited by its quotients. (4) Examples are examined in detail, a large range including both ones of mathematical curiosity and ones of physical interest, such as cosmic strings in flat, accelerated, Schwarzschild, Kerr, and other backgrounds.},

	abstract = {It is argued that the general four-dimensional extremal Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS black hole is holographically dual to a (chiral half of a) two-dimensional CFT, generalizing an argument given recently for the special case of extremal Kerr. Specifically, the asymptotic symmetries of the near-horizon region of the general extremal black hole are shown to be generated by a Virasoro algebra. Semiclassical formulae are derived for the central charge and temperature of the dual CFT as functions of the cosmological constant, Newton's constant and the black hole charges and spin. We then show, assuming the Cardy formula, that the microscopic entropy of the dual CFT precisely reproduces the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking area law. This CFT description becomes singular in the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom limit where the black hole has no spin. At this point a second dual CFT description is proposed in which the global part of the U(1) gauge symmetry is promoted to a Virasoro algebra. This second description is also found to reproduce the area law. Various further generalizations including higher dimensions are discussed.},

	abstract = {A new technique for the study of noncompact complete spacelike hypersurfaces in generalized Robertson\textendash{}Walker (GRW) spacetimes whose fiber is a parabolic Riemannian manifold is introduced. This class of spacetimes allows us to model open universes which extend to spacelike closed GRW spacetimes from the viewpoint of the geometric analysis of the fiber, and which, unlike those spacetimes, could be compatible with the holographic principle. First, under reasonable assumptions on the restriction of the warping function to the spacelike hypersurface and on the hyperbolic angle between the unit normal vector field and a certain timelike vector field, a complete spacelike hypersurface in a spatially parabolic GRW spacetime is shown to be parabolic, and the existence of a simply connected parabolic spacelike hypersurface in a GRW spacetime also leads to the parabolicity of its fiber. Then, all the complete maximal hypersurfaces in spatially parabolic GRW spacetimes are determined in several cases, extending, in particular, to this family of open cosmological models several well-known uniqueness results for the case of spatially closed GRW spacetimes. Moreover, new Calabi\textendash{}Bernstein problems are solved.},

	abstract = {We discuss some general properties of quantum gravity in De Sitter space. It has been argued that the Hilbert space is of finite dimension. This suggests a macroscopic argument that General Relativity cannot be quantized -- unless it is embedded in a more precise theory that determines the value of the cosmological constant. We give a definition of the quantum Hilbert space using the asymptotic behavior in the past and future, without requiring detailed microscopic knowledge. We discuss the difficulties in defining any precisely calculable or measurable observables in an asymptotically de Sitter spacetime, and explore some meta-observables that appear to make mathematical sense but cannot be measured by an observer who lives in the spacetime. This article is an expanded version of a lecture at Strings 2001 in Mumbai.},
