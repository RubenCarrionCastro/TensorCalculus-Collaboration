# Tensor Calculus Notes (Collaboration Project)

These notes were developed as part of an academic collaboration with the Department of Mathematics at the University of Córdoba (Spain).  
I participated as an *Alumno Interno* (Undergraduate Internal Student) during the academic year 2023–2024, working under the supervision of Prof. Jónatan Herrera Fernández.

The project consists of a structured set of tensor calculus notes intended to formalize and clarify concepts related to:
- Tensor algebra
- Coordinate transformations
- Metric tensors
- Raising and lowering indices

## 📘 Authorship
The material in this repository originates from a co-authored document:

- **Prof. Jónatan Herrera Fernández**
- **Rubén Carrión Castro**

The LaTeX structure, writing, and mathematical formalization were carried out collaboratively.  
My contributions include:
- Drafting and typesetting the notes in LaTeX  
- Expanding explanations based on discussions and guidance from the professor  
- Organizing the material into a coherent pedagogical structure  
- Incorporating examples and clarifications to improve readability
